# CS1010S Finals Template

This repository provides the Python file (.py) template to the past CS1010S, CS1010X, and CS1010FC finals if one decides to do it using Python IDE.
Regardless, in the real final examination, Python IDE is not allowed for use and students are to do it by hand, i.e. write the code down on paper or use Examplify and type it manually without any debugging/compiling if online.

There is only CS1010S on the title because the questions are taken from the *workbin* of **only CS1010S**.

> Please note that the answers and solutions are **NOT** provided for obvious reasons.

## General Notes
+ I will not focus on code tracing questions but still provide empty spaces for these questions. This is because the code has to be run line-by-line on Python Shell instead of IDE, thus it may give different results.
+ I will definitely not put the final question in the template file (most of the students know why), but I will provide spaces for the other non-code questions like explaining why a certain part of the code does not work.
+ For each question that involves defining functions, I will provide the test cases provided in the PDF of the question paper, which I will not put here.
+ I will also provide the corresponding code appendixes on each end of the template file. Therefore, the list of built-in syntaxes such as `list.append(<item>)` will be excluded.
+ If you are reading this during finals, I wish you **all the best** for it!

## Other Notes
### CS1010S
+ The main content of the workbin. The format of each paper is *by far* the same.
    + **Question 1 :** Code Tracing
        > Revolves around string, sequences, exception handling, if-else clauses, and lambdas.
    + **Question 2 :** List/Tuple Processing
    + **Question 3 :** Dictionary Processing
    + **Question 4 :** Object-Oriented Programming
        > Revolves around inheritance, polymorphism, and diamond inheritance.
    + **Question 5 *(not provided in the template file)* :** Course Reflection

## Final Technical Notes
+ I will indent almost all the testings into a function such as `test_q3a()` or `test_q4()`, depends on the situation.
+ Do not mind the shebang line on the top of each file, they won't affect anything right :)
